# Jabberwocky
*Beware the Jabberwock, my son!*
*      The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!*
*Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun*
*      The frumious Bandersnatch!‚Äù*

### Planned Features
- Sentence/paragraph generation (random, potentially with constraints)
- Contexts: a logical container for multiple sentences, paragraphs, phrases, etc for use in logic processing (not planned for this library just yet)
- Language agnosticism: whether working with English sentences or French ones, the features and concepts should be the same and continue to work as intended
- Custom words support? (or ensure adding new words is easier than forking the protect and writing more c++)
